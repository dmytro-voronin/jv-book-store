Welcome to the online bookstore management systemâ€”your reliable partner in the literary business!
Developed with the needs of book online store owners in mind,
this application provides efficient tools for managing your literary content.

##### Features:

- Easy to manage: Easy to search, add and update books,
  categories and orders - everything you need to effectively manage your store.

- Data Security: We recognize the importance of protecting your information.
  Our system uses strong authentication and authorization mechanisms with JWT tokens for secure transactions.
  The new application was created taking into account your convenience in managing an online book store,
  providing effective tools to grow your business.

##### History of creation:

I once encountered a problem: cool books are far away, and time is limited.
And then an idea appeared: why not create an application where you can buy a book directly online?
The whole point is that everyone can easily find and order interesting books without leaving home.
I was inspired by the desire to make reading accessible to everyone, in any time and place.
Imagine, now your bookshelf is always at hand,
and you can easily find something new to read.
My application is like a store where everyone will find something to their liking.
So let's open the doors together to the fascinating world of words and adventures!

### Startup instructions

#### amazon cloud:

<img src="icons/aws.png" alt="Bookstore Logo" width="100" height="100" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

If you want to quickly test this application,
then you can not install it locally, but simply follow the link to the deployed application in Amazonaws.
The result will be exactly the same. 
[Swagger](http://ec2-54-91-229-61.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8081/api/swagger-ui/index.html#/) 
and 
[Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) available.

#### easy way:

- your computer must have [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed.
- create a new directory and download [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) from [easystart](easystart/) package
- in the same directory create ".env" file. For example:
```
MYSQLDB_USER=root
MYSQLDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=4rfgt56yh
MYSQLDB_DATABASE=bookstore
MYSQLDB_LOCAL_PORT=3308
MYSQLDB_DOCKER_PORT=3306
SPRING_LOCAL_PORT=8088
SPRING_DOCKER_PORT=8080
DEBUG_PORT=5005
```
- in the terminal, being in this folder, enter the command:
```bash
docker compose up
```
#### or the JAR build path:
- your computer should still have [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed.
- Clone this repository.
- Create a .env file in the root folder.
- if Maven is not installed on your machine, you can download and install it from the [Maven website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
- in the terminal, being in book-store folder, enter the command:
```bash
mvn package
```
- and finally:
```bash
docker compose up
```
#### after launch:
- you will be able to send http requests to the port SPRING_LOCAL_PORT specified in the .env file
- for example, you can open the page in your browser at http://localhost:8088/api/swagger-ui/index.html
  where 8088 = SPRING_LOCAL_PORT specified in the .env file by default. Or use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

### Postman

- Here I have prepared a collection for Postman. For convenience, the SPRING_LOCAL_PORT is set to the default value of 8088.
- Thanks to this collection, you can test the functionality of the application in a very clear and detailed manner.
- Import this file into your Postman.
  [book store requests postman collection](Book%20store%20requests.postman_collection.json) from [postman](postman/) package
### Technical details

It's worth noting that the application implements a role system with USER and ADMIN roles.
Some functionality is only accessible with administrator privileges, namely:
- create/create all/delete/update book
- create/delete/update category
- update order status

All other functionality is accessible to everyone.
There is a default user created with administrator privileges:
- name: admin.test@example.com
- password: 12345678
